agents: this was my first multi agent workflow using OpenAI's AgentSDK. While these terms are still abstract, I comprehend their utilization in the future of compute. This is my workflow for creating the Ethical Gating and Intent Licensing in slipstream, which is in AWS and has run loops succcessfully, gating drifted requests.
