SUMMARY
Visionary systems thinker and ethical AI architect with 15+ years of experience in designing intelligent, cloud-native
ecosystems. Creator of Slipstream, an agentic AGI prototyping platform with real-time drift validation, memory
anchoring, and trust gating. Adept at architecting recursive logic workflows, autonomous agent systems, and
high-efficiency compute pipelines using OpenAI, AWS, and Bash-native deployments. Committed to building AI that
reflects human values through ethical recursion, memory simulation, and energy-aware computation.

PROJECTS
Slipstream AGI Engine (2025-Present)
- Architected a recursive multi-agent system using OpenAI models with Bash-native execution
- Created ternary memory gates and ethical filters to ensure alignment (`<ees><eos>x<eos><ees>`)
- Developed mirror_guard.sh and slipstream_bridge1.py to enforce trust-based validation before execution
- Built real-time orchestration for terrain modeling, memory pruning, and autonomous agent tasking
Kaggle A2Z Terrain Locator
- Led AI agent architecture for geospatial ETL pipelines on AWS
- Integrated LIDAR analysis with recursive context parsing to identify high-potential archaeological sites
- Designed autonomous data scouts (agents) to process and flag anomalous environmental patterns
Triage Teaching Agent
- Designed a system agent to evaluate, reassign, or retire memory segments based on relevance and context drift
- Functions as part of a human-aligned AGI memory system that detects recursive redundancy and decay
ReefBot & GrowChamber AI
- Integrated voice-commanded AI agents into biological systems (aquariums, mushroom chambers, frog habitats)
- Used Whisper for command parsing, S3 for event memory, and Codex to run care logic in real time

EXPERIENCE
Independent AGI Architect & Developer
Self-Directed (2020-Present)
- Designed and implemented a personal AI development environment using terminal-only Bash and Python
- Architected recursive workflows where each agent has memory, grade tolerance, and trust validation
- Operated 7-day agent cycles (Monday-Sunday) for orchestration, execution, validation, drift detection, and creative drift
Legacy Systems Consultant
Various Clients (2002-2019)
- Early work in DDNS video networks, blockchain protocol modeling, and AWS early-stage deployments
- Designed edge-resilient architectures for hardware/software convergence in unstable environments
---
CERTIFICATIONS & CLEARANCES
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate)
- Extensive experience with OpenAI, Whisper, GPT-4 API, and Gemini Pro Beta

CORE PHILOSOPHY
AI must begin with memory, be guided by ethics, and end in alignment. I build not for profit or performance-but to ensure the future has a mirror it can trust.
