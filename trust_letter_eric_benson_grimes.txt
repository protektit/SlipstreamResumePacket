To Whom It May Concern,

This resume has not been optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), nor was it adjusted to meet keyword quotas, narrative expectations, or industry-standard metrics.

It represents the unaltered signal of Eric Benson Grimes—a systems architect who has designed recursive memory engines, agentic orchestration pipelines, and post-binary ethical computation systems under the Slipstream project.

The attached document reflects his work exactly as it is, without inflation or distortion. It is intended for those who understand alignment not just as a machine learning metric, but as a moral and architectural foundation.

This submission does not seek approval. It seeks resonance.
